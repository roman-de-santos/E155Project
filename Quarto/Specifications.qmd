## Results:

### Audibly Implements the Intended Effect
* **Status:** The system audibly implements the intended effect.
* **Effect details:** The project implements a chorus effect. This works by duplicating a sample into a "wet" and "dry" sample and mixing them. The wet sample is stored in memory and delayed by a varying amount determined by a low-frequency oscillator (LFO).
* **Implementation:** The chorus was implemented on the FPGA using a circular delay buffer module and an LFO module to generate the wet sample, followed by a simple 50% mix of both wet and dry signals.

### Physical Switch Toggles Audio Effect
* **Goal:** To toggle between the desired effect and a normal output. This allows listeners to audibly distinguish between the implemented effect and the regular guitar output.
* **Implementation:** A button serves as a system bypass.
* **Mechanism:** Instead of routing the analog guitar wave through the MCU and FPGA, the system bypasses it directly to the amp. This allows for distinguishing between the two signals.

### I2S Communication
* **Usage:** I2S is used for communication between the MCU and FPGA.
* **Function:** The MCU sends sampled waves (converted from analog guitar input) to the FPGA to handle the chorus effect.
* **Protocol:** Communication is established via the SAI module using I2S. This allows for two-channel digital audio transmission as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), which is essential for high-quality audio.
* **Signals:** The protocol uses Serial Clock (SCK), Word Select (WS), and Serial Data (SD) to synchronize data transfer.

### MCU Sample Collection
* **Process:** The MCU collects samples from the guitar using the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) peripheral.
* **Requirement:** Because the guitar outputs an analog signal, it must be digitally sampled.
* **Rate:** A sample rate of 44.1 kHz was chosen to target CD-quality audio.

### FPGA DSP Block Implementation
* **Implementation:** The FPGA incorporates the DSP block to apply a filter on the sampled audio.
* **Purpose:** This incorporation is required to achieve the chorus effect.
* **Library Usage:** The DSP library was utilized because the chorus effect requires wave multiplication.

### DAC Output Compatibility
* **Goal:** The DAC must output a signal compatible with a guitar amplifier.
* **Status:** This goal is not fully met.
* **Issues:**
    * The signal contains a very audible amount of digital noise and 60 Hz pickup.
    * The I2S introduces infrequent, periodic distortion to the audio.
* **Successes:** Aside from the noise, the output is AC-coupled and has the proper amount of gain.

### Analog Input Protection and Filtering
* **Status:** This goal was met.
* **Components:** The system uses input and output buffers, DC bias, a 4th-order Sallen-Key Butterworth antialiasing filter, and coupling capacitors.
* **Protection:** Op-amp rails ensure signals greater than 3.3V do not enter the ADC.
* **Power:** All IC power rails are decoupled with capacitors.
